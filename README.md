This is just a clone of trello that I have started working on.<br>
I plan to have it up an running in around a week of work although it wont be fully finished in that time frame.

# Requirements:
- NPM / Node.js
- Firebase Database

# Installation:
Download all the files and put them into a folder.<br>
Open the console and navigate to the folder you put all of those folders into.<br>
Run ```npm i``` to install all the node modules.
### Start dev server
Run ```npm run serve``` in the console and go to ```http://localhost:8080```
### Build application
Run ```npm run build``` in the console

# Technologies:
The backend currently uses Firebase to handle all requests.<br>
And the frontend uses Vue 2.6 with the following plugins:
- vue-router
- Vuetify
- MDI Icons

# Done:
- Home page
- Login & Signup Design
- Footer
- Main workflow

# Todo:
- Start using Vite
- Add the actual functionality / trello cards
- Migrate to Vue 3
- Add google recaptcha
- Add email verification
- Add password resetting
