# TrelloClone
This is just a clone of trello that I have started working on.<br>
I plan to have it up an running in around a week of work although it wont be fully finished in that time frame.

# Technologies:
The backend currently uses an Express API with MongoDB although I plan on changing to Firebase.
And the frontend uses Vue 2.6 with the following plugins:
- vue-router
- Vuetify
- MDI Icons

# Done:
- Home page
- Footer
- Main workflow

# Todo:
- Start using Vite
- Setup firebase or some other state handler
- Fix login page
- Add the actual functionality / trello cards
